Idempotency means that making the same request multiple times has the exact same effect as making it only once.

Idempotency of different HTTP request methods:

1. GET (Idempotent and Safe)
   If you refresh your browser 10 times, you just see the same page 10 times.
   Nothing changes on the server.

2. PUT (Idempotent)
   If you make a change on the server and then make the same change again,
   in both scenarios the final state of the database remains the same.

3. DELETE (Idempotent)
   If a file is deleted from the database and you try to delete it again,
   an error may be returned, but the final state of the database remains unchanged.

4. POST (Not Idempotent)
   Creating a new resource using POST is not idempotent because the same request
   can create multiple resources. For example, if a customer places an order and
   the same request is sent again, a new order will be created each time.
